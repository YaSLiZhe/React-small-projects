## The useEffect Dependency Array

By default, an effect in React runs after each render. However, we can change this default behavior by passing a dependency array as the second argument to the `useEffect` hook.

But why does `useEffect` need a dependency array? Without it, React doesn't know when to run the effect. By specifying the effect dependencies in the dependency array, the effect will be executed each time one of the dependencies changes.

The dependencies in the array are typically state variables and props used inside the effect. It's important to include all the relevant dependencies in the array. If a dependency like a state variable or prop is not included in the array, React won't know about its changes, leading to bugs like stale closures.

Think of the `useEffect` hook as an event listener that listens for changes in one or more dependencies. When a dependency changes, the effect is executed again. It's reactive, just like how React reacts to state updates by re-rendering the UI.

There are three types of dependency arrays:

1. Multiple dependencies: If the array contains multiple dependencies, the effect runs on the initial render and whenever any of the dependencies change.
2. Empty array: If the array is empty, the effect runs only on mount (initial render). It doesn't synchronize with any state or props.
3. No array: If there's no array at all, the effect runs on every render, which is usually not desired.

Effects are executed asynchronously after the render has been painted on the screen by the browser. This allows long-running processes within effects, like data fetching, to not block the rendering process.

It's important to note that if an effect sets state, an additional render will be required to display the UI correctly. This is one of the reasons why overusing effects should be avoided.

There is also a layout effect, which runs before the browser paints the new screen. However, its use is discouraged in most cases.

Understanding and correctly specifying the dependency array is crucial for proper synchronization and managing the component lifecycle.
